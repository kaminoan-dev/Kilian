### Kilian is an app that provides accurate time estimates for trekking trails, helping hikers plan their journey with ease.

## Description

Unlike most apps that primarily focus on path planning, navigation, and guidance, Kilian targets users who have already planned a hiking trip and want to know how long it will take to complete the journey with their companions.

Kilian allows users to input various segments or tracks of their hiking route, including the horizontal distance, altitude difference, M.I.D. level, and physical condition of the hiker. Based on this information, the app calculates the estimated hiking and resting times for each segment, providing users with valuable insights to plan their hiking adventures effectively.

### What is the M.I.D. classification?

The M.I.D. ("Medium", "Itinerary", and "Difficulty in Displacement") classification method is utilized to rate the difficulty of excursions. This classification system, recommended by the Spanish Federation of Mountain Sports and Climbing ("Federación Española de Deportes de Montaña y Escalada" or FEDME), offers a comprehensive evaluation of the routes, enabling users to make informed decisions about their hiking plans.

It considers three aspects:
* Severity of the natural environment:
	1. The environment is not risk-free.
	2. There is more than one risk factor.
	3. There are several risk factors.
	4. There are several risk factors.
	5. There are many risk factors.
* Orientation in the itinerary:
	1. Well defined paths and crossings.
	2. Paths or signage indicating continuity.
	3. Requires accurate identification of geographical features and cardinal points.
	4. Requires off-track navigation.
	5. Navigation interrupted by obstacles that must be skirted.
* Difficulty in displacement:
	1. Walking on smooth surfaces.
	2. Walking on bridle paths.
	3. Walking on staggered paths or uneven terrain.
	4. The use of hands or jumping is necessary to maintain balance.
	5. Requires the use of hands for progression.
